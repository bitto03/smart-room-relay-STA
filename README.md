#  Smart Room Relay Switch (ESP8266 + Web Control)

This is a Wi-Fi-based room light automation project using an ESP8266 (NodeMCU). You can turn your room light ON/OFF through a custom web interface, schedule actions, and even toggle dark mode for fun. Built entirely in **STA Mode**, the ESP8266 connects to your Wi-Fi and serves a clean UI accessible via browser.

##  Features

- Turn ON/OFF light from browser
- Schedule a time to toggle light (client-side)
- Dark mode toggle (just for fun)
- Connects to your existing Wi-Fi (STA Mode)
- Minimalist interface for fast load
- Works without internet (LAN only)

## Hardware Required

- ESP8266 NodeMCU
- Relay module (5V)
- Light bulb (or any load)
- Jumper wires
- Power supply (via USB or adapter)
